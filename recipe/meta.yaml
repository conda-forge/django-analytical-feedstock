  summary: The django-analytical application integrates analytics services into a Django project.
  description: |
    Using an analytics service with a Django project means adding Javascript
    tracking code to the project templates. Of course, every service has its
    own specific installation instructions. Furthermore, you need to include
    your unique identifiers, which then end up in the templates. Not very nice.
    This application hides the details of the different analytics services
    behind a generic interface, and keeps personal information and configuration
    out of the templates. Its goal is to make the basic set-up very simple,
    while allowing advanced users to customize tracking. Each service is set up
    as recommended by the services themselves, using an asynchronous version of
    the Javascript code if possible.
